# Integrated-Retail-Analytics-for-Store-Optimization-and-Demand-Forecasting

# Project Summary
This project focuses on building a robust end-to-end retail analytics solution to predict weekly sales for retail stores. By leveraging historical sales data and various external factors, the project aims to provide a reliable forecasting tool to support data-driven business decisions.

# Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis of sales trends, seasonal patterns, and the impact of external factors.

- Data Integration: Merging multiple datasets (sales, store details, and features) to create a comprehensive analytical dataset.

- Predictive Modeling: Development of a supervised regression model to forecast weekly sales.

- Model Optimization: Use of hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to enhance model accuracy.

# Datasets
The project utilizes three primary datasets:

- sales data-set.csv: Contains historical sales data, including Store, Dept, Date, Weekly_Sales, and IsHoliday.

- stores data-set.csv: Provides details about each store, such as Store, Type, and Size.

- Features data set.csv: Includes external factors that influence sales, such as Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, Unemployment, and MarkDowns.


# Methodology
The methodology followed a standard machine learning workflow:

- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and prepared the datasets for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized and analyzed the relationships between different features and weekly sales.

- Model Building: Implemented and evaluated several regression models, including Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Applied techniques like Randomized Search to find the optimal parameters for the best-performing models.

# Model Performance
The tuned XGBoost model emerged as the top performer. Its final metrics are as follows:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.01

- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.02

- R-squared (R 2): 0.9998

An RÂ² score of 0.9998 is a near-perfect result, indicating that the model explains almost all of the variability in weekly sales and provides exceptionally accurate predictions.

# Conclusion & Business Value
The project successfully delivered a powerful sales forecasting tool. The tuned XGBoost model is highly reliable and provides valuable insights into the key factors that drive sales, such as previous sales trends, markdowns, store size, and economic indicators. This model can be used to support critical business decisions related to inventory planning, promotions, and overall store optimization.
